# IaC Structure Framework

This document presents a Terraform project structure inspired on the layered architecture from the software architectural pattern and Terraform best practices. Based on my experience I designed this approach to make it easy for organizations to achieve efficient and secure cloud infrastructure management.

## Key Features of the Terraform Framework

- **Layers Design:** Leveraging a layered design, the architecture promotes both simplified management and loose coupling between layers, enhancing maintainability and flexibility.

- **Clear Separation of Concerns and Maintainability:** Each layer has a clear purpose, making it simpler to understand and modify specific parts of your infrastructure.

- **Simplified Collaboration:** Facilitate clear code organization and onboarding for new team members.

- **Environment Isolation:** Effortlessly manage separate environments for development, staging, and production, ensuring safe experimentation and smooth deployments.

- **Security:** The framework's structure can implement a well-organized security approach, facilitating the implementation of best practices like least privilege access, regular security audits.

- **Compliance:** The layered design easy configurations that meet specific compliance requirements like PCI DSS and HIPAA.

- **Disaster Recovery:** The structure streamlines disaster recovery planning and implementation, ensuring business continuity.

- **Scalability:** The framework is designed to be scalable to accommodate the growing needs of organizations as they expand their cloud infrastructure.

## Layers of the Terraform Framework
This layered approach defines two functional layers: 

**Implementation Layers:** These layers focus on provisioning and configuring essential cloud resources.

**Integration Layers:** These layers ensure secure and controlled access to resources managed by the implementation layers.

### Implementation Layers
It consists of four layers. These four layers work together to manage the cloud infrastructure.

#### Governance Layer: The Foundation of Security and Access

It focuses on establishing admin account settings, security and access controls for the infrastructure. While it doesn't directly provision resources like servers or databases, it manages configurations related to the whole organization management and access control to various services. Here's how it can be used:

- **General Service Settings:** It defines admin configurations for services that has terraform providers, These include services like:

    - **Version Control:** Define repositories and access controls for services like GitHub or GitLab.

    - **Communication:** Manage main channels, bots, and integrations for tools like Slack.

    - **Cloud Management:** Configure account creation settings for cloud providers like AWS.

    - **Project Management:** Define global settings for project management tools like Jira.

    - **Identity and Access Management:** Configure centralized access controls through tools like Okta.

* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** acts as a central hub for managing policies for all Terraform stacks/workspaces on different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). This helps to ensure consistent security across your infrastructure.


#### Core Layer: The Essential Building Blocks

The Core Layer is the foundation of your workload cloud infrastructure. It defines the essential building blocks that provide the basic functionality for your applications to run securely.  Here's what typically resides in the Core Layer:

- **Networking:** Terraform stack/workspace used to configure and manage the virtual networks that connect your resources. This includes defining subnets, security groups (firewalls), and routing rules to control network traffic flow.
    - Subnets
    - Security Groups
    - Routing Rules

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** It can configure internal or external DNS services.

- **Security:** This aspect focuses on foundational security configurations within your infrastructure:

    - **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** While full IAM might reside in the Governance Layer for stacks/workspaces, the Core Layer might define basic user permissions and access controls for resources within the workload infrastructure.
    - **Security Groups (as mentioned in Networking):** These play a crucial role in restricting access to resources based on IP addresses or security group memberships.
    - **Certificates (Optional):** In some cases, the Core Layer might manage certificates for internal services or resources within the workload infrastructure, but this could also be handled elsewhere depending on your security practices.

 
#### Service Layer: Reusable Services for Efficiency

The Service Layer centralizes the provisioning and management of reusable resources that can be shared across various environments. These resources support both business and internal  infrastructures:

- **Databases:** Services  like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Aurora.
- **Message Queues:** Enable asynchronous communication between parts of your application (e.g., SQS or Kafka).
- **Caching Services:** Services like Redis or Memcached.
- **ML/AI:** Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure.
- **CI/CD:** Services like Jenkins, Spinnakers and others.


#### Application Layer: Tailoring Infrastructure for Apps

This layer represents the dedicated floors for the business applications. Here, you define resources specific to your applications' needs, such as:

- **Web Servers:** Apache, Nginx (configuration, security policies, deployments).
- **Application Servers:** Tomcat, JBoss, or others (provisioning and configuration).
- **Storage:** File systems or object storage for application data.
- **Helm Charts:** Package and deploy Kubernetes manifests (configurations) for containerized applications.

The Application Layer ensures your applications have the resources they need to function effectively within the overall infrastructure.

### Integration Layers
The layered design ensures that only essential resource information is accessible to the same or upper layers, promoting security.

- **Core Module:** Provides essential resource details created in the core layer.

- **Service Module:** Provides essential resource details created in the service layer.


### Getting Started: Implementing the Framework

Now that you understand the core principles, unleash the power of this framework for efficient and secure cloud management.

For smaller, initial projects, a monolithic Terraform repository might be sufficient. However, for larger or more complex projects, defining separate repositories for each layer (Governance, Core, Service, Application) is recommended. This promotes better organization, maintainability, and collaboration.
